						<h1>Personal Information</h1>
			<p>I have been employed as a civil engineer for 16 years starting when I was a junior in high school.  My career began as a design drafting technician and progressed into obtaining my engineering degree, licensure as a professional engineer and on to project management and office management. </p>
			<p>I am now looking at changing careers and becoming a Web/Application developer.  My desire for a career change began with the start of a flight school in my hometown, Butte, MT.  I developed a website for this business, <a href="http://www.jjaviation.com" target="_blank">JJ Aviation</a>, and found that I very much enjoyed the challenge of web development.  I then tried my hand at android application development in order to build a partner application for the website.  I have enjoyed teaching myself HTML but I recognize that I will need additional guidance if I am to continue to learn developer skills.  To that end I am searching for opportunities to be a virtual intern for a development company.</p>
		<h1>Portfolio</h1>
			<p><a href="http://www.jjaviation.com" target="_blank">JJ Aviation Website</a> - Created to support a flight school started by my husband and I.  The website was my first exposure to web development and was created using self-taught HTML.</p>
			<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.v1_4.B328D0498199646E72E3F5A7.com" target="_blank">Complete Pilot App</a> - Created as a mobile version of the JJ Aviation Website.  The application was created using Buzztouch and very little code writing was required.  However, the content has been popular and since itâ€™s publication, the application has over 1,000 installs.  My intention is to enhance the application in the future with additional features and links.</p>
		<h1>Employment</h1>
		<h2 class="company"> DOWL HKM (1998 to Present)</h2>
			<p>The Butte DOWL HKM engineering office includes administrative staff, geotechnical, water, wastewater, and transportation engineers, construction inspectors, drafters, and IT staff.  As the office manager, I am responsible for developing a business plan for the office, controlling office expenses, adding staff, marketing new and existing clients, and mentoring the existing staff.  In addition, I manage the second largest client in the Western Montana Region of DOWL HKM, which includes 5 offices, while concurrently managing up to 8 other projects.</p>
